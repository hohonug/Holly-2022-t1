        <h4>Podcasting: In August of 2022 I created a new posdcasting series to celebrate my passion for music. The
          series will be an ongoing exploration into the music my friends, family and peers hold close to them. Stay up
          to date and check it out here!</p>

      <p>I have been trained in many forms of writing and have worked as a co-editor. I have also co-ordinated and
        directed plays with the Melbourne University's International House and so leading a high concept project is
        something I am both comfortable and excited to do. </p>

      <p>I have wanted to be a cross-platform creator since I stepped into my writing for videogames class at RMIT
        in 2016. Exploring new ways to create has helped me grow as a writer and I can only see the writing
        potential get bigger and bigger. </p>

          <p>Writing scripts across platforms, from TV to web to short films. A huge element of my experience in
            screenwriting is understanding the power of a visual and the restraint in dialogue. Email me for more

      <h2>Accessibility and Understanding </h2>

      <p>It is integral to my creative process and general ethos that whatever I am working with is as accessible as
        possible. I have been trained to understand the value of accessible design and representation. </p>

      <p>With each project that I have worked on, before I start writing, I interview people and follow their
        perspective as well as research whatever topic or idea I am running with. It is important to me to know more
        than my own opinion and so even if it is for a short story I will strategically question relevant people and
        consider
        different options to how something can be viewed. It is a matter of something new turning up that I had not
        considered before that can really build or stop a story.</p>

      <p>In the cases of covering characters, people, or stories
        that might be out of my own understanding, I have found that it is always best to ask those who might be
        affected by the content or know someone who could be. In this way, I can ensure the experience of all involved
        will be more likely to be positive.</p>
