          <h4>I am a multi-platform creator based in Melbourne. I have trained in professional screenwriting, radio
            presenting, digital and social media content creation and through my own interests I have founded and
            managed my own digital business. </h4>

          <h4>I love to explore how stories can carry across mediums and styles, whether
            it is an Instagram caption or a TV episode. Using digital and physical spaces for storytelling is a passion
            of mine, and I am constantly searching for the next project to inspire me. </h4>

      <h4>What can I do for you?</h4>

      <p>Due to my training at RMIT and Collarts, I can effectively communicate stories across platforms, maintain brand
        image across campaign concepts and happily collaborate with teams. </p>

      <p>I initially started writing plays as a teenager and have found that this created my ability to see the bigger
        picture in a concept, and work from there. Each beat or point of interest should make sense, and have good
        intent.</p>

      <p>Creating Odd Odyssey in 2020 allowed me to experience digital spaces as more than a blog space, and have
        enjoyed the
        process of developing a brand and seeing how it fits within an online industry. </p>

      <p>If there is a project you are wanting to contact me about or you just want to chat all things creative, head
        over to my contact page to find out how to let me know!</p>
